# Sean's Advent of Code solutions for 2015

This is the code I developed and used to solve the Advent of Code puzzles for 2015. They may not be the prettiest things, but they work. Why am I using a server with express? I don't know, just felt like it. (Actually I just remixed an old project I was working on and cleaned that out, then started. That's why the index.html looks like random boxes and a button.)
