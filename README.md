My attempts to complete the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2022. I am building this on Glitch and I am using Javascript w/ Node and Express as the main framework. I tend to just log my results in the console, if I'm feeling fun though I may put them into the actual webpage. Oh and I try to track my notes and what I've learned each day in the md file named learnings2022.

I am not an amazing programmer by any means- I just enjoy these challenges and they are very rewarding when you actually figure them out. To also participate go to [adventofcode.com/2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
