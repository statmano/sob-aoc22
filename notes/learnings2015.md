# Notes and Things I've Learned

### Day One

- To access get requests' data sent on the server-side, you need to use `data.query`
- Don't forget in your loops of arrays that it's the `arr[][]` to get the elements themselves looped

### Day Three

- Array inside an array annoying to locate - used `.some` prototype function
- The console wanted to log the end result of the array even if it wasn't filled in yet (that was weird). Had to add elements into a variable using bracket notation to the array- at least I _think_ I had to.
- You're getting sloppy with the functions- part two works but was not elegant at all

### Day Four

- Hashing, weird stuff, but once I found a formula, it was pretty quick
- substrings go UP TO BUT NOT INCLUDE the second number, yipes
